\chapter{Objectives and Hypotheses}\label{chapter:objectives-hypotheses}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective 1}: Determine essential design principles for Human-AI interactions.
    \item \textbf{Objective 2}: Identify flaws in current chat-based interfaces and methods to abstract prompt complexities.
    \item \textbf{Objective 3}: Assess the impact of a dynamic GUI on knowledge workers' productivity, quality, and efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypotheses}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1}: GUI-based interfaces improve performance metrics over text-based interfaces.
    \item \textbf{H2}: User experience level affects performance across interfaces.
    \item \textbf{H3}: GUI effectiveness is greater for novice users than experts.
    \item \textbf{H4}: Experts perform equally well on both interfaces; novices perform better with the GUI.
\end{itemize}
